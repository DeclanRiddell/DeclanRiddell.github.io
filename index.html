			<h2>Patient Obesity Level Predictive Classification Model</h2>
			<p>The leading cause of death in the world is heart disease! Obesity is the leading risk of developing heart disease. 
			   Catching obesity early, and identifying leading factors in determining a patients obesity level or risk of obesity
			   could lead to early therapeutic targeting which could help to stifle the leading cause of death across the world.</p>

			<p>The goal of this project was to take a dataset reported by patients detailing their health scope. This included things
			   from activity levels, family history, and diet. With this factor analysis I was aiming to find the most important of
			   the groupings, whether that be physical, genetic, or dietary in order to determine the best course of treatment to 
			   reduce obesity level and help prevent heart disease.</p>
