			<h2>Patient Obesity Level Predictive Classification Model</h2>
			<p>The leading cause of death in the world is heart disease! Obesity is the leading risk of developing heart disease. 
			   Catching obesity early, and identifying leading factors in determining a patients obesity level or risk of obesity
			   could lead to early therapeutic targeting which could help to stifle the leading cause of death across the world.</p>

			<p>The goal of this project was to take a dataset reported by patients detailing their health scope. This included things
			   from activity levels, family history, and diet. With this factor analysis I was aiming to find the most important of
			   the groupings, whether that be physical, genetic, or dietary in order to determine the best course of treatment to 
			   reduce obesity level and help prevent heart disease.</p>

			<h2>Comprehensive Analysis of NGS Omics Data Reveals Distinct Gene Expression Profiles in Cancer Cell Lines K562 and MCF-7</h2>
			<p> Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled the detailed examination of
				genomic landscapes, offering insights into the complex mechanisms of disease, particularly
				cancer. This study leverages NGS to analyze the gene expression profiles of two pivotal cancer
				cell lines: K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and MCF-7 (breast cancer). Through rigorous
				data acquisition, quality control, reads alignment, mutation calling, gene expression analysis, and
				gene functional enrichment, we elucidate the molecular underpinnings that differentiate these
				cell lines. Our findings provide valuable insights into the gene expression dynamics and
				mutational landscapes characteristic of leukemia and breast cancer, contributing to the broader
				understanding of cancer biology and offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention</p>

			<p>The advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has profoundly impacted
				biomedical research, particularly in the study of cancer. By enabling comprehensive profiling of
				gene expression and genomic mutations, NGS offers unparalleled insights into the molecular
				mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression. This study focuses on the analysis
				of NGS data from two widely studied cancer cell lines: K562, a model for studying chronic
				myelogenous leukemia, and MCF-7, a model for breast cancer research. These cell lines
				represent distinct cancer types, providing a valuable opportunity to explore the molecular
				diversity underlying hematological and solid tumors</p>
