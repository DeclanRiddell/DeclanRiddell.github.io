			<h2>Patient Obesity Level Predictive Classification Model and Comprehensive Feature Analysis</h2>
			<p>The leading cause of death in the world is heart disease! Obesity is the leading risk of developing heart disease. 
			   Catching obesity early, and identifying leading factors in determining a patients obesity level or risk of obesity
			   could lead to early therapeutic targeting which could help to stifle the leading cause of death across the world.</p>

			<p>The dataset provides information on obesity levels with data regarding their diet and physical activity. Contained in 
				the dataset are basic qualifier variables like gender, age, and height. Along with those, there are some interesting fields 
				that I am curious to see if they have a correlation with the level of obesity. Examples would be use of technological devices, smoking, 
				or whether the person monitors their calories on a daily basis. There are some interesting hypotheses you can base off of social norms, 
				for example someone who uses their phone more or plays more video games would be much more likely to be obese based on the 
				implication that they are not very physically active. Or perhaps someone who monitors their calories on a daily basis would be more 
				likely to not be obese, as that type of behavior is usually associated with someone who might be very into lifting weights or maintaining 
				a certain level of physique.</p>

			<p>The goal of this project was to take a dataset reported by patients detailing their health scope. This included things
			   from activity levels, family history, and diet. With this factor analysis I was aiming to find the most important of
			   the groupings, whether that be physical, genetic, or dietary in order to determine the best course of treatment to 
			   reduce obesity level and help prevent heart disease.</p>

			<h2>Comprehensive Analysis of NGS Omics Data Reveals Distinct Gene Expression Profiles in Cancer Cell Lines K562 and MCF-7</h2>
			<p> Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies have enabled the detailed examination of
				genomic landscapes, offering insights into the complex mechanisms of disease, particularly
				cancer. This study leverages NGS to analyze the gene expression profiles of two pivotal cancer
				cell lines: K562 (chronic myelogenous leukemia) and MCF-7 (breast cancer). Through rigorous
				data acquisition, quality control, reads alignment, mutation calling, gene expression analysis, and
				gene functional enrichment, we elucidate the molecular underpinnings that differentiate these
				cell lines. Our findings provide valuable insights into the gene expression dynamics and
				mutational landscapes characteristic of leukemia and breast cancer, contributing to the broader
				understanding of cancer biology and offering potential targets for therapeutic intervention</p>

			<p> The advent of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies has profoundly impacted
				biomedical research, particularly in the study of cancer. By enabling comprehensive profiling of
				gene expression and genomic mutations, NGS offers unparalleled insights into the molecular
				mechanisms underlying cancer development and progression. This study focuses on the analysis
				of NGS data from two widely studied cancer cell lines: K562, a model for studying chronic
				myelogenous leukemia, and MCF-7, a model for breast cancer research. These cell lines
				represent distinct cancer types, providing a valuable opportunity to explore the molecular
				diversity underlying hematological and solid tumors</p>

			<h2>Menu Drive Football Statistics Application with Python and redisDB</h2>
			<p> The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding of redisDB and API usage in a Python application.
				The application will take input from the user, query the API for the requested data, filter the data
				into the necessary information, store it in the redisDB structure, and then display that information 
				to the user.The project can be cloned and ran from the command line if you wanted to try it out.</p>
			
			<p>Tools: Python, Python-Strings, pandas, redisDB, http-client</p>

			<h2>Linux Namespace Performance Metrics Application</h2>
			<p> The goal of this project was to gain a better understanding Linux Namespaces. Linux uses three types of IPCs,
				or Inter Process Communications. These three are Shared Memory, Semaphores, and Message Queues. There are two
			    versions of these IPCs, POSIX and SYSV. This product was designed and developed in order to measure the performance 
				of each of these IPC’s within their native environment, and then compare that to the performance of these IPC’s within a
				Namespace. A Namespace is essentially an isolation of the system’s kernel resources that allows a single process 
				to utilize all components of the system at once to ensure maximum performance.</p>
